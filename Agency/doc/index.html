		Agency is a framework for doing Agent-Based Computational Economics
		(ACE) using the <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/ecj/">ECJ</a>
		evolutionary computation system. We believe these models require some
		features which are different from most other uses of either
		Agent-Based models generally (e.g., <a
			href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/">NetLogo</a> or GMU's <a
			href="http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/">MASON</a>) or or
		Evolutionary Computation systems without an agent simulation
		component. Our implementation may be somewhat different from the ECJ
		paradigm, but we hope not so much that it, or at least parts of it,
		might be distributed as a contributed module of ECJ.

	<h1>Overview</h1>
	<p>Using evolutionary computation in agent-based models requires
		that (1)</p>

	<h1>Terminology</h1>
	<p>"Individual", "agent", and "strategy" are sometimes used
		interchangeably in this document. Technically, these are different
		concepts. An "individual" in this context refers to the entities
		operated on by the genetic algorithm, each of which has its own
		(possibly unique) genome. An "agent" is a similar entity, but in the
		context of an ACE domain model. In this system, there may be agents
		that do not have an associated individual, for example, in the case of
		consumer agents we do not intend to subject to evolutionary pressures.
		However, all individuals operating within the domain model do so as
		agents in the ABM sense. Finally, a "strategy" is the complete set of
		conditional rules that control the behavior of an agent within within
		the simulation. It is technically distinct from the individual because
		the latter includes only the genetic representation itself, and not
		the instructions (code) controlling how that representation is
		translated into actions that are intelligible to the ACE domain model.</p>


	<h1>Agent Diversity</h1>
	<h2>Justification</h2>
	<p>One of the central features of the Agency is that it allows evolutionary
		simulation models to use agents not just with heterogenous genomes, but
		with heterogenous evolutionary representations as well.  The purpose
		of this feature is to address (and hopefully remediate) results that
		are driven more by artifacts of the modeling process than the
		underlying phenomenon.  This should serve to strengthen the external
		valdity of the ACE model.  Without this kind of diversity, a significantly
		smaller part of the strategy space can be expressed, which, due to the
		complexities of evolutionary game theory, can significantly effect 
		the results.</p>
		
	<p>While the strategy space may be effectively infinite, in the sense that
		it dwarfs available computational resources, using only a single 
		learning/behavioral algorithm greatly narrows the strategies that
		can be explored.  The results may be quite different if a classifier
		system is used as opposed to a genetic algorithm as opposed
		to reinforcement learning as opposed to a hybrid of one or more
		learning algorithms and some human intuition of the modeler.  If
		the results vary based on these arbitrary decisions of model
		implementation, how can we possibly have any faith in the model's
		results?  Allowing different evolutionary representations and perhaps
		even non-EC learning methods allows a more systematic exploration
		of these different approaches.  Perhaps one set of strategies
		is strongly dominated by all other strategies?  If all are subject
		to evolutionary pressure, the

	<h3>Suitability of Existing Evolutionary Computation Packages</h3>
	
	
	<h3>Implementation Time for Agents of Different Representations</h3>
	<p>The mere theoretical ability to allow coevolution of agents with
	different learning algorithms less meaningful if the difficulty of
	implementing agents that use these methods and the time required to

	<h1>The Interface between ECJ and Agency Models</h1>
	<p>
		In many problem domains in evolutionary computation, the calculation
		of fitness for any one individual is relatively simple. This can be
		seen in the way ECJ uses its <a
			href="http://www.cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/ecj/docs/classdocs/ec/Problem.html"><code>ec.Problem</code></a>
		interface. The typical case for many EC problems is that each
		individual can be evaluated in isolation, apart from the other
		individuals in the population. ECJ does include some facilities for
		evolution in groups (see the ECJ documentation on <a
			href="http://www.cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/ecj/docs/classdocs/ec/coevolve/GroupedProblemForm.html"><code>GroupedProblemForm</code></a>,
		<a
			href="http://www.cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/ecj/docs/classdocs/ec/coevolve/MultiPopCoevolutionaryEvaluator.html"><code>MultiPopCoevolutionaryEvaluator</code></a>,
		and §7.1 of the <a
			href="http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/ecj/docs/manual/manual.pdf">ECJ
			Owner's Manual</a>), but it is unclear that the existing system can be
		configured to suit our purposes, and, even if so, that conceptual
		mismatches between the two approaches would make using the ECJ system
		easier or better in both the short and long terms. Instead, it seems
		likely that implementing the agent grouping process we intend will be
		easier to accomplish with code, and the integration of that code with
		the ECJ interface is, at this point, relatively trivial.
	</p>

	<h2>Agent Diversity: Implementation</h2>
	

	<h2>Agent Grouping</h2>
	<p>There are a number of different issues that need to be taken
		into account when creating a set of agents to be evaluated together in
		the domain-specific simulation. They are caused by (1) game-theoretic
		equilibrium concepts, (2) the need for diversity between different
		evolutionary representations within a single agent type, and (3) the
		need to combine different agent types within the same domain model
		simulation. This section will proceed by describing a number of
		different grouping strategies, and discussing the strengths and
		weaknesses of each in light of the goals of ACE modeling.</p>


	<h3>Simple, Flat Sampling</h3>
	<p>Perhaps the simplest method of creating groups of agents to be
		evaluated together within the ACE domain model is to randomly sample
		from all the individuals within the evolutionary computation system.
		In ECJ, this would mean iterating through each sub-population (which
		always contains exactly one agent type using the same representation)
		to create a single, large pool of individuals. A simplistic sampling
		algorithm would then be able to randomly draw individuals from this
		population until a specified number of individuals were obtained. That
		group would then be given to an ACE domain model to obtain a sample
		fitness.</p>

	<p>Remember, agent/individual fitness is not absolute but can only
		be measured in comparison with other individuals that are in the
		agent's evaluation group. In simple games like the prisoner's dilemma
		(and to some extent with the slightly more complicated iterated
		version), it is possible to represent the entire strategy space in
		computer memory. As dominated strategies are removed from the
		population, the performance of the remaining strategies will change,
		because results depend also on the actions of other players, and the
		individual is more likely to come up against strategies that were more
		successful in earlier generations and are therefore more often
		expressed within the population. The concept is similar to a Nash
		equilibrium; there may be a formal term for it from evolutionary game
		theory with which I am not yet familiar.</p>

	<p>There is, however, a problem with this approach when dealing
		with heterogeneous agent representations. These representations are
		contained within an ECJ entity called a sub-population. The
		evolutionary and breeding processes occur only within these
		sub-populations. In other words, when choosing which individuals to
		maintain in the population, only individuals from the same
		sub-population are considered. Related, the standard practice in ECJ
		is that sub-populations are fixed in size.</p>

	<p>
		Say, for example, that a particular type of individual/agent always
		does poorly in comparison with other agents. Ordinarily, this would be
		called a <i>dominated</i> strategy, and, <i>if all relevant
			individuals were treated as part of the same evolutionary pool</i>, that
		class of strategies would become extinct, or at least less often
		expressed. Instead, because the size of sub-populations remains fixed,
		the proportion of the dominated class of strategies remains fixed, and
		the dominated strategies will then be over-selected when creating
		groups for the ACE domain models. The other groups will then take into
		account, as a part of their evolutionary process, the extent to which
		strategies can take advantage of these dominated strategies to
		increase their overall average fitness. However, as discussed above,
		this may (likely does) skew the evolved representations away from what
		would be the equilibrium suggested by evolutionary game theory.
	</p>

	<p>There are (at least) two ways of dealing with this. The first is
		to allow the size of the sub-populations to vary with respect to each
		other based on their relative fitness. The second is to take this into
		account during the group selection process. Both have their advantages
		and disadvantages, and neither one has as of this writing been
		implemented. (It is therefore possible that software artifacts within
		either system may make one or the other more or less practical or
		desirable).</p>

	<h3>Scaling the Size of Sub-Populations</h3>

	<p>Modifying the breeding process to take into account the relative
		fitness of each individual type/class and scaling population size
		accordingly seems to be more consistent with the general approach to
		evolutionary computation, and avoids some of the problems with scaling
		by weighted sampling. The principle difficulty seems to be that the
		ECJ system was not designed to dynamically scale the size of
		sub-populations when dealing with co-evolutionary environments. On the
		other hand, if this view is accurate, and an ECJ breeder can be
		built/modified in this way, it would represent an independent
		contribution to the ECJ system, and may be a separate fertile area for
		research publication as well.</p>

	<p>One issue that would need to be addressed in such an
		implementation is that a single ECJ population will, in some cases and
		including our own ACE domain model, require an additional layer of
		grouping. For instance, while all NSP individuals should be part of
		the same evolutionary pool, they should not be in the same
		evolutionary pool with all ASP individuals as well. This requires the
		creation of groups of arbitrary sub-populations that the modified ECJ
		breeder would act upon. For example, sub-populations 0, 4, and 9 may
		be treated as part of evolutionary pool A, while the other
		sub-populations are treated as part of evolutionary pool B. This
		should be possible relatively easily by using configuration parameters
		passed through ECJ's evolve.conf to the new/modified ECJ breeder.</p>

	<h3>Weighted Sampling from Sub-Populations</h3>
	<p>If may be appropriate to separate the size of the populations
		from the frequency for which they are selected for inclusion in
		domain-model simulations, perhaps to ensure a minimum population size.
		In that case, pure scaling of the sub-population may not be
		sufficient. On the other hand, keeping a large population size even
		when the individuals are infrequently chosen for inclusion in
		domain-model simulations would make evaluation of the entire
		sub-population quite difficult; it may require an excessive number of
		evaluations for other sub-populations or other tricks. It may be
		appropriate to combine weighted sampling with bounded sub-population
		scaling, or to simply ignore the issue for now.</p>

	<h2>Threaded Evaluation</h2>
	<p>ECJ's MultiPopCoevolutionaryEvaluator is single-threaded. Since
		CPUs have been scaling recently by adding processor cores rather than
		increasing the clock speed of existing cores, a multi-threaded
		implementation has a few advantages. Primarily, it allows us as
		developers to make better use of our own computing resources for
		testing and development purposes. Being able to chew through
		non-trivial simulations quickly allows a more rapid model iteration
		process; this is not as important when scaling up experiments by
		running large numbers of ECJ instances on a high-performance computing
		cluster, but it does have some usefulness.</p>

	<p>
		Unlike ECJ's <a
			href="http://www.cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/ecj/docs/classdocs/ec/simple/SimpleEvaluator.html"><code>SimpleEvaluator</code></a>,
		which evaluates each individual in the population separately, we
		cannot simply divide the population into separate subsets for each
		thread to evaluate independently. Instead, we need to create groups of
		agents to hand off to a simulation instance, and these groups should
		be constructed primarily based on characteristics other than the
		thread that happens to be executing them. Our approach is instead to
		use the <a
			href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ThreadPoolExecutor.html"><code>ThreadPoolExecutor</code></a>
		that was included as of Java 1.5. Instances of the domain model are
		required to implement the Java Runnable interface, so that they can be
		scheduled for execution. However, the current threading implementation
		is incomplete and may be modified based on experience. The most
		important thing is just that (1) the domain models are executed, and
		(2) the fitness values for the individuals that were a part of that
		simulation are passed on to something that will ultimately assign a
		fitness value for use in the breeding phase of the evolutionary
		algorithm.
	</p>


	<h1>Patterns for Domain Simulations</h1>
	<h2>Interfaces for Agents</h2>
	<p>
		One of the central features of this package is, as stated above, the
		ability to co-evolve different representations of individual agents
		performing the same role within the domain simulation. As Java does
		not allow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance">Multiple
			Inheritance</a>, this requires that the domain model and individual
		agents interact with each other through a Java interface. For example,
		here are the interfaces and implementation shell of the iterated
		prisoner's dilemma model and a specific agent representation that uses
		a genetic algorithm similar to those described in previous work by
		Axerlrod.
	</p>

	<pre>
public interface IteratedPDAgent {
	public boolean defect(IteratedPDSimulation state);
}
</pre>

	<p>
		Each of the specific agent classes, which in simple cases are likely
		to inherit from an ECJ
		<code>Individual</code>
		class, must then implement that interface. As described in the section
		below on passing state information, it may not have been the best idea
		simply to pass the entire simulation state. Instead, the agent could
		have been passed a pair of binary arrays, each describing either this
		agent's or its opponents defections in the past <i>n</i> rounds. In
		any case, the class of the object representing this agent (i.e., the
		instance of Individual) must implement the interface. Again, from the
		iterated prisoners dilemma example:
	</p>

	<pre>
public class IteratedPDAgentGA implements IteratedPDAgent {
	...
	public boolean defect(IteratedPDSimulation state) {
		
		Boolean toDefect = null;
		boolean[] myDefections = state.getDefections(this);
		boolean[] opponentDefections = state.getDefections(state.getOtherAgent(this));
		
		// if step 1, just take our decision directly from the genome.
		if (state.step == 0) {
			toDefect = ind.genome[0x54];
		}
		...
	}
}
</pre>



	<p>
		The interface defines what the agents need to do within the
		simulation. It has a few advantages over the simple step(state) method
		used by Mason in the ACE problem domain. Specifically, controlling the
		order of operations if often an important part of the domain model,
		and it is not always desirable for all agents to perform all their
		functions at once. However, when the order in which agents are
		executed <em>within</em> an action phase is important, care should be
		taken not to introduce any additional artifacts into the simulation.
	</p>


	<p>Once the agent interface has been defined, the simulation
		interacts with the agents using that interface. For example, the main
		loop of the iterated prisoner's dilemma simulation is excerpted below.
		No matter what internal genetic representation or strategies are used
		within the agents, as long as they implement the same interfaces for
		communication with the simulation, they can all act and co-evolve
		within the same simulation.</p>

	<pre>
for (int i = 0; i < this.stepsToRun; i++) {
	// Ask agents whether or not they're defecting
	boolean firstDefected = firstDefections[step] = first.defect(this);
	boolean secondDefected = secondDefections[step] = second.defect(this);
	...
}
</pre>


	<h2>Separation of State Information</h2>

	<p>It is important that agent-model instance specific information
		not be stored in the Individual object from ECJ. The reason for this
		restriction is that the individual is likely to be run in several
		different simulations, perhaps simultaneously, and state information
		would become corrupted in this case. There may also be issues with
		storing that state across generations if the objects for the agents
		and the ECJ representations are merged. (i.e., as opposed to creating
		a separate agent object once each domain-model evaluation)The other
		advantage of this approach is that the state information would be
		stored in one place so that it would be easier to understand the
		entire simulation state (i.e., not having state information scattered
		elsewhere in the object graph)</p>

	<p>Rather, the suggestion is to keep model and agent state within
		the domain model and in as few separate objects as reasonably
		possible, to make the state easier to fully understand and document
		Instead, state information should be passed to individuals through
		the agent API.</p>

	<p>In the case of relatively simple models, it maybe appropriate to
		pass in the objects relevent to the decision directly. While this
		requires the simulation to marshal those resources when calling the
		agent API, it does make that API more clearly defined. In the case of
		more complicated models, it may be appropriate to pass in the entire
		simulation state and have the code within the individual itself handle
		the task of gathering the appropriate information from the simulation
		state. At the least, this will probably include some identifier to
		match the individual with a specific agent within the domain-model
		simulation. If agents have a more detailed state, it is likely
		appropriate to create a separate object representing the state of one
		particular agent. That agent state can then be passed to the
		individual as part of the agent API.</p>

		the best and most widely understood model in game theory, and the
		results obtained in using the Agency package can be compared to past
		research as a way of validating other aspects of the design of this
