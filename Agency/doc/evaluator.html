 <div class=title>Agency: Evaluator</div>

 <div class=abstract>
  The agency evaluator extends the ECJ <code>Evaluator</code> class, which
  performs the role of calculating the fitness scores for individuals that are
  used by the selection phase of the evolutionary algorithm. This is one of the
  major features provided by Agency and its implementation (and justifications
  for) is described in this document.

 <h1>Overview</h1>

 <p>
  Evaluating the fitness of individuals is a task that must be performed in any
  evolutionary computation system. In ECJ, this is done with with a class
  appropriately named <a
   href="http://www.cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/ecj/docs/classdocs/ec/Evaluator.html"><code>Evaluator</code></a>.
  Thankfully, ECJ is designed in such a way (using OO principles and a versatile
  configuration) that overriding the default behavior with one that is more
  appropriate to agent-based models is relatively simple and can be done in a
  modular way that does not require modification of the ECJ source itself. This
  document describes how the agency evaluator is implemented and can be
  configured.
 </p>

 <p>
  The evaluator and related classes are required to implement the <a
   href="http://www.cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/ecj/docs/classdocs/ec/Setup.html"><code>ec.Setup</code></a>
  interface, which allows these objects to configure themselves from the ECJ 
  <a href="http://www.cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/ecj/docs/classdocs/ec/util/ParameterDatabase.html"><code>ParameterDatabase</code></a>,
  which is populated from the main ECJ configuration file.
 </p>

 <h1>Creating Evaluation Groups</h1>
 <p>
  Unlike in many uses of evolutionary computation, where the fitness of
  individuals can be calculated by examining a single individual in isolation,
  the fitness of agents in an agent-based model is similar to the fitness of a
  strategy in game theory. There, the outcome of any given strategy depends on
  the strategies chosen by other players in the game. The logic of choosing the
  best strategy given that other players will be doing the same thing results in
  a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium">Nash Equilibrium</a>,
  and, in the evolutionary context, the <a
   href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionarily_stable_strategy">Evolutionarily
   Stable Strategy</a> refinement of it.
 </p>

 <p>However, there is typically a (large) mismatch between the number of
  players that are part of any individual game and the size of the populations
  that make evolutionary computation useful. This means that a (usually large)
  number of subsets of the population must be created and evaluated together.
  For example, the number of players in the prisoner's dilemma game is 2, while
  the population size would be at least 100.</p>

 <p>
  Futher, there are a few things that need to be kept in mind while doing these
  evaluations. First, in order for the evolutionary algorithm to work with the
  entire population, each individual must be evaluated <i>at least once</i> so
  that it has a non-null fitness score. Second, evaluating an agent only once
  gives a very poor estimate of its expected performance as compared with the
  entire population. On the other hand, running a comparison against all
  possible groups of agents scales extraordinarily poorly; even in the case of a
  two agent game, this would require <i>N<sup>2</sup></i> evaluations, where <i>N</i>
  is the size of the population. The math gets much, much worse with games where
  there are a larger number of agents in a simulation. Therefore, the system
  that creates groups of agents for inclusion in a single game and runs the
  simulations should evaluate each individual an appropriate number of times to
  make sure that there is a reasonable collection of sample fitnesses to provide
  a reliable aggregate fitness measure to the selection phase of the
  evolutionary algorithm. (As an aside, there is also the issue of how multiple
  fitness samples are aggregated into a single fitness measure to be used by the
  EA. For now, we are using the assumption that a simple average is reasonable.)

 <p>
  The options in the ECJ configuration file that control the evaluation process
  shown below. The first line should be the same for all agent-based models
  using Agency. The second two lines specify the specific Java classes that <a
   href="javadoc/abce/agency/ec/ecj/AgencyEvaluator.html"><code>AgencyEvaluator</code></a>
  will use to accomplish its tasks of group creation and model evaluation. Both
  the <code>groupcreator</code> and the <code>simrunner</code> will have their
  own configuration options specific to their implementation. For example, the <a
   href=javadoc/abce/agency/ec/ecj/LoopRunner.html><code>LoopRunner</code></a>
  is a single threaded evaluator that simply iterates through the groups
  provided by the group creator and runs each directly. It is extremely simple,
  intended for single-threaded environments and requires no further
  configuration. Likewise, the <a
   href=javadoc/abce/agency/ec/ecj/RandomFlatGroupCreator.html><code>RandomFlatGroupCreator</code></a>
  is also quite simple; it combines all individuals from all sub-populations
  into one large pool, then iterates through that pool <code>eval.groupcreator.rounds</code>
  times, randomly choosing <code>eval.groupcreator.groupSize - 1</code> other
  agents as part of the evaluation group. Other groupers will need to be written
  to deal with situations where there are multiple different roles for agents
  within the simulation, each targeted by a specific subset of the available
  sub-populations within the ECJ <a
   href=http://www.cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/ecj/docs/classdocs/ec/EvolutionState.html><code>EvolutionState</code></a>.
  That configuration needs to specify which sub-populations go with which roles
  and how many agents should be assigned to fill each one of the role
  sub-groups.
