	<h2>
		<a name="ipd">Iterated Prisoners' Dilemma</a>
	</h2>
	<p>
		This model is similar to that described by <cite>Axelrod (1997)
			<span class=fn_text> Axelrod, R. (1997). The Evolution of
				Strategies in the Iterated Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma. In C. Bicchieri, R.

		</cite> Its purpose is to serve as a test-bed for development, tutorial, and
		testing purposes. The prisoners' dilemma game was chosen because it is
		the best and most widely understood model in game theory, and the
		results obtained in using the Agency package can be compared to past
		research as a way of validating other aspects of the design of this
		system. In addition, it serves as an example of software patterns to
		use in the rest of the system.

	<h2>Cournot Oligopoly Model</h2>
	<p>Like the iterated prisoners' dilemma model, the Cournot
		oligopoly model is included because it is extremely well-known and has
		been studied extensively. It is therefore useful for providing a
		benchmark for testing and tutorial purposes. In particular, it should
		be useful for testing the different learning models, the performance
		of which is related to a substantial line of past research.

	<h2>Cournot Oligopoly with Investment</h2>
	<p>This model adds multi-market and capital investment properties
		to the standard Cournot oligopoly model. Rather than having a fixed
		production cost, the per-unit cost of production is also determined by
		the level of past capital expenditure, using a cobb-douglass
		production function. In addition, firms compete over a number of
		different markets, with information about the number of</p>

	<h1>Ideas for Future Development</h1>
	<h2>Separation of State Information</h2>
	<p>In the past, there have been a few minor issues caused storing
		state within an individual agent class and that object being shared by
		multiple simulation threads simultaneously. There may also be issues
		with storing that state across generations if the objects for the
		agents and the ECJ representations are merged. (i.e., as opposed to
		creating a separate agent object multiple times for each evaluation
		and generation of the same individual.) The alternative would be for
		agents to ask the simulation object for their own state. The other
		advantage of this approach is that the state information would be
		stored in one place so that it would be easier to understand the
		entire simulation state (i.e., not having state information scattered
		elsewhere in the object graph)</p>
