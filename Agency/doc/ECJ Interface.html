	<div class=abstract>
		Agency is a framework for doing Agent-Based Computational Economics
		(ACE) using the <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/ecj/">ECJ</a>
		evolutionary computation system. We believe these models require some
		features which are different from most other uses of either
		Agent-Based models generally (e.g., <a
			href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/">NetLogo</a> or GMU's <a
			href="http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/">MASON</a>) or or
		Evolutionary Computation systems without an agent simulation
		component. Our implementation may be somewhat different from the ECJ
		paradigm, but we hope not so much that it, or at least parts of it,
		might be distributed as a contributed module of ECJ.
	</div>

	<h1>Overview</h1>
	<p>Using evolutionary computation in agent-based models requires
		that (1)</p>

	<h1>Terminology</h1>
	<p>"Individual", "agent", and "strategy" are sometimes used
		interchangeably in this document. Technically, these are different
		concepts. An "individual" in this context refers to the entities
		operated on by the genetic algorithm, each of which has its own
		(possibly unique) genome. An "agent" is a similar entity, but in the
		context of an ACE domain model. In this system, there may be agents
		that do not have an associated individual, for example, in the case of
		consumer agents we do not intend to subject to evolutionary pressures.
		However, all individuals operating within the domain model do so as
		agents in the ABM sense. Finally, a "strategy" is the complete set of
		conditional rules that control the behavior of an agent within within
		the simulation. It is technically distinct from the individual because
		the latter includes only the genetic representation itself, and not
		the instructions (code) controlling how that representation is
		translated into actions that are intelligible to the ACE domain model.</p>



	<h1>The Interface between ECJ and Agency Models</h1>
	<p>
		In many problem domains in evolutionary computation, the calculation
		of fitness for any one individual is relatively simple. This can be
		seen in the way ECJ uses its <a
			href="http://www.cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/ecj/docs/classdocs/ec/Problem.html">ec.Problem</a>
		interface. The typical case for many EC problems is that each
		individual can be evaluated in isolation, apart from the other
		individuals in the population. ECJ does include some facilities for
		evolution in groups (see the ECJ documentation on <a
			href="http://www.cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/ecj/docs/classdocs/ec/coevolve/GroupedProblemForm.html">GroupedProblemForm</a>,
		<a
			href="http://www.cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/ecj/docs/classdocs/ec/coevolve/MultiPopCoevolutionaryEvaluator.html">MultiPopCoevolutionaryEvaluator</a>,
		and §7.1 of the <a
			href="http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/ecj/docs/manual/manual.pdf">ECJ
			Owner's Manual</a>), but it is unclear that the existing system can be
		configured to suit our purposes, and, even if so, that conceptual
		mismatches between the two approaches would make using the ECJ system
		easier or better in both the short and long terms. Instead, it seems
		likely that implementing the agent grouping process we intend will be
		easier to accomplish with code, and the integration of that code with
		the ECJ interface is, at this point, relatively trivial.

	</p>

	<h2>Agent Diversity</h2>

	<h2>Agent Grouping</h2>
	<p>There are a number of different issues that need to be taken
		into account when creating a set of agents to be evaluated together in
		the domain-specific simulation. They are caused by (1) game-theoretic
		equilibrium concepts, (2) the need for diversity between different
		evolutionary representations within a single agent type, and (3) the
		need to combine different agent types within the same domain model
		simulation. This section will proceed by describing a number of
		different grouping strategies, and discussing the strengths and
		weaknesses of each in light of the goals of ACE modeling.</p>


	<h3>Simple, Flat Sampling</h3>
	<p>Perhaps the simplest method of creating groups of agents to be
		evaluated together within the ACE domain model is to randomly sample
		from all the individuals within the evolutionary computation system.
		In ECJ, this would mean iterating through each sub-population (which
		always contains exactly one agent type using the same representation)
		to create a single, large pool of individuals. A simplistic sampling
		algorithm would then be able to randomly draw individuals from this
		population until a specified number of individuals were obtained. That
		group would then be given to an ACE domain model to obtain a sample
		fitness.</p>

	<p>Remember, agent/individual fitness is not absolute but can only
		be measured in comparison with other individuals that are in the
		agent's evaluation group. In simple games like the prisoner's dilemma
		(and to some extent with the slightly more complicated iterated
		version), it is possible to represent the entire strategy space in
		computer memory. As dominated strategies are removed from the
		population, the performance of the remaining strategies will change,
		because results depend also on the actions of other players, and the
		individual is more likely to come up against strategies that were more
		successful in earlier generations and are therefore more often
		expressed within the population. The concept is similar to a Nash
		equilibrium; there may be a formal term for it from evolutionary game
		theory with which I am not yet familiar.</p>

	<p>There is, however, a problem with this approach when dealing
		with heterogeneous agent representations. These representations are
		contained within an ECJ entity called a sub-population. The
		evolutionary and breeding processes occur only within these
		sub-populations. In other words, when choosing which individuals to
		maintain in the population, only individuals from the same
		sub-population are considered. Related, the standard practice in ECJ
		is that sub-populations are fixed in size.</p>

	<p>
		Say, for example, that a particular type of individual/agent always
		does poorly in comparison with other agents. Ordinarily, this would be
		called a <i>dominated</i> strategy, and, <i>if all relevant
			individuals were treated as part of the same evolutionary pool</i>, that
		class of strategies would become extinct, or at least less often
		expressed. Instead, because the size of sub-populations remains fixed,
		the proportion of the dominated class of strategies remains fixed, and
		the dominated strategies will then be over-selected when creating
		groups for the ACE domain models. The other groups will then take into
		account, as a part of their evolutionary process, the extent to which
		strategies can take advantage of these dominated strategies to
		increase their overall average fitness. However, as discussed above,
		this may (likely does) skew the evolved representations away from what
		would be the equilibrium suggested by evolutionary game theory.
	</p>

	<p>There are (at least) two ways of dealing with this. The first is
		to allow the size of the sub-populations to vary with respect to each
		other based on their relative fitness. The second is to take this into
		account during the group selection process. Both have their advantages
		and disadvantages, and neither one has as of this writing been
		implemented. (It is therefore possible that software artifacts within
		either system may make one or the other more or less practical or
		desirable).</p>

	<h3>Scaling the Size of Sub-Populations</h3>

	<p>Modifying the breeding process to take into account the relative
		fitness of each individual type/class and scaling population size
		accordingly seems to be more consistent with the general approach to
		evolutionary computation, and avoids some of the problems with scaling
		by weighted sampling. The principle difficulty seems to be that the
		ECJ system was not designed to dynamically scale the size of
		sub-populations when dealing with co-evolutionary environments. On the
		other hand, if this view is accurate, and an ECJ breeder can be
		built/modified in this way, it would represent an independent
		contribution to the ECJ system, and may be a separate fertile area for
		research publication as well.</p>

	<p>One mechanistic issue that would need to be addressed in such an
		implementation is that a single ECJ population will, in some cases and
		including our own ACE domain model, require an additional layer of
		grouping. For instance, while all NSP individuals should be part of
		the same evolutionary pool, they should not be in the same
		evolutionary pool with all ASP individuals as well. This requires the
		creation of groups of arbitrary sub-populations that the modified ECJ
		breeder would act upon. For example, sub-populations 0, 4, and 9 may
		be treated as part of evolutionary pool A, while the other
		sub-populations are treated as part of evolutionary pool B. This
		should be possible relatively easily by using configuration parameters
		passed through ECJ's evolve.conf to the new/modified ECJ breeder.</p>

	<h2>Threads</h2>
	<p>ECJ's MultiPopCoevolutionaryEvaluator is single-threaded. Since
		CPUs have been scaling recently by adding processor cores rather than
		increasing the clock speed of existing cores, a multi-threaded
		implementation has a few advantages. Primarily, it allows us as
		developers to make better use of our own computing resources for
		testing and development purposes. Being able to chew through
		non-trivial simulations quickly allows a more rapid model iteration
		process; this is not as important when scaling up experiments by
		running large numbers of ECJ instances on a high-performance computing
		cluster, but it does have some usefulness.</p>

	<p>
		Unlike ECJ's <a
			href="http://www.cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/ecj/docs/classdocs/ec/simple/SimpleEvaluator.html">SimpleEvaluator</a>,
		which evaluates each individual in the population separately, we
		cannot simply divide the population into separate subsets for each
		thread to evaluate independently. Instead, we need to create groups of
		agents to hand off to a simulation instance, and these groups should
		be constructed primarily based on characteristics other than the
		thread that happens to be executing them. Our approach is instead to
		use the <a
			href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ThreadPoolExecutor.html">ThreadPoolExecutor</a>
		that was included as of Java 1.5. Instances of the domain model are
		required to implement the Java Runnable interface, so that they can be
		scheduled for execution. However, the current threading implementation
		is incomplete and may be modified based on experience. The most
		important thing is just that (1) the domain models are executed, and
		(2) the fitness values for the individuals that were a part of that
		simulation are passed on to something that will ultimately assign a
		fitness value for use in the breeding phase of the evolutionary
		algorithm.

	<h1>Demonstration Models</h1>

	<h2>
		<a name="ipd">Iterated Prisoners' Dilemma</a>
	</h2>
	<p>
		This model is similar to that described by <cite>Axelrod (1997)
			<span class=fn_text> Axelrod, R. (1997). The Evolution of
				Strategies in the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma. In C. Bicchieri, R.

		</cite> Its purpose is to serve as a test-bed for development, tutorial, and
		testing purposes. The prisoners' dilemma game was chosen because it is
		the best and most widely understood model in game theory, and the
		results obtained in using the Agency package can be compared to past
		research as a way of validating other aspects of the design of this
		system. In addition, it serves as an example of software patterns to
		use in the rest of the system.

	<h2>Cournot Oligopoly Model</h2>
	<p>Like the iterated prisoners' dilemma model, the Cournot
		oligopoly model is included because it is extremely well-known and has
		been studied extensively. It is therefore useful for providing a
		benchmark for testing and tutorial purposes. In particular, it should
		be useful for testing the different learning models, the performance
		of which is related to a substantial line of past research.

	<h2>Cournot Oligopoly with Investment</h2>
	<p>This model adds multi-market and capital investment properties
		to the standard Cournot oligopoly model. Rather than having a fixed
		production cost, the per-unit cost of production is also determined by
		the level of past capital expenditure, using a cobb-douglass
		production function. In addition, firms compete over a number of
		different markets, with information about the number of</p>

	<h1>Ideas for Future Development</h1>
	<h2>Separation of State Information</h2>
	<p>In the past, there have been a few minor issues caused storing
		state within an individual agent class and that object being shared by
		multiple simulation threads simultaneously. There may also be issues
		with storing that state across generations if the objects for the
		agents and the ECJ representations are merged. (i.e., as opposed to
		creating a separate agent object multiple times for each evaluation
		and generation of the same individual.) The alternative would be for
		agents to ask the simulation object for their own state. The other
		advantage of this approach is that the state information would be
		stored in one place so that it would be easier to understand the
		entire simulation state (i.e., not having state information scattered
		elsewhere in the object graph)</p>
