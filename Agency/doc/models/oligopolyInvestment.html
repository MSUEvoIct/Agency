<div class="title">Agency: Oligopoly/Investment Model</div>

<p>This model provides an economic environment where an arbitrary number of firms
can compete in an arbitrary number of markets for a single good.  Each firm has
a cobb-douglas form production function, where the amount of labor may be
chosen freely each model time step but the level of capital is a function of
the investment of that firm over time.  Consumers are represented in the
traditional fashion, as a demand curve where market clearing is performed by a
virtual Walrasian auctioneer.</p>

<p>Model Parameters Include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of markets
</li><li>The cost of capital</li>
<li>The cobb-douglas exponent for capital
</li><li>The cost of labor
</li><li>The cobb-douglas exponent for labor
</li><li>The number of consumers in each market
</li><li>The maximum amount a consumer is willing to pay
</li><li>A coefficient and exponent describing how consumer WTP decreases with
    the number of consumers 
</li></ul>

<h1>Code</h1>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>The code for this model is in models/ source directory, in the package
abce.models.io.investment.  The main simulation class is uncreatively named
InvestmentModel.  The parameters for consumer demand may vary across markets, 
and are stored in the public variables maximumWTP, qtyRatio, and qtyExponent.</p>

<p>InvestmentModel implements the Java interface Runnable, so each model may be
executed in a separate thread if desired.  The inner model loop is specified 
in the InvestmentModel.run() function.  First, the model steps all of firms
by calling their purchaseCapital() and setProduction() functions, in that 
order.  Once production is set, all markets are cleared by the
InvestmentModel.clearMarket() function.  This function aggregates the production
quantities for each market, and uses the consumerWTP() function to determine
the market price.  Each firm then receives an amount of revenue equal to that
price multiplied by that firm's amount of production.  All that remains for the
model step is to perform the maintenance of state variables to reflect the
move to the next time step.</p>

<p>Firms are required only to implement the abce.models.io.investment.InvestmentFirm
interface.  In addition to the purchaseCapital() and setProduction() functions
described above, firms are required to implement interfaces that verify and
actualize the actions for purchasing capital and setting production, represented
by the CapitalPurchaseAction and ProductionAction classes respectively.  This
pattern should insure that agents do not e.g., spend more resources on 
production than they have available.  A BasicInvestmentFirm class is also 
present to perform these functions using the general-purpose accounting code
provided by Agency.</p>
