  <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>The FileManager coordinates the opening and closing of files.  It
      achieves this by keeping a map of file paths to file handles.  If a file
      path is not present in this mapping, the file is opened; if it is present,
      the file object is returned.  For conveneicne, the file manager also keeps
      track of a working directory in which all files are created.</p>

      <p>The file manager and all file types created by the file manager should
      be synchronized; this is because multiple threads may be writing to the
      file at once.  For example, a single replicate experiment might be writing
      pricing and production information every 10 steps; but there might be 100
      of such threads possible, 10 running at a time.</p>

      <p>Initialization of the filemanager is independent of its creation.  This
      was a deliberate design decision to keep the constructor of the
      filemanager consistant with ECJ's style of reflective creation via
      newInstance().  (Otherwise we'd have to know the signature of the
      constructor, and do additional checking for its creation.).  However, at
      the moment, this type of reflective creation is not done, so the design
      decision is maleable.  Currently, all initialization does is setup the
      root (working) directory if it does not exist or throw an exception if the
      directory path points to an extant regular file.</p>

      <p>All file names should be passed as strings; there is no reason to
      enforce this aside from making sure getter methods only have one type of
      parameter signature.</p>

      <p>When a file is requested, the method takes the name getFileType(String
      path, ...).  The working directory is prepended to the path provided.  If
      the file is already in the map of active files, the file object is
      returned provided it matches the expected file type.  If it does not match
      the expected file type, an IOException is thrown.  If the file path is not
      in the active queue, then the file is opened as if it were new, replacing
      the file on disk.</p>

      <p><em>TODO: keep inactive list of files to make sure that only new files
        are created; otherwise they should probably be created in appened rather
        than truncate mode</em></p>

      <p>Presently both the EC and domain models use the same file manager as to
      coordinate actions.  I believe this design decision should be a
      requirement in order to ensure no race conditions are created; a
      centralized fIO facility is needed to ensure this.</p>

      <p>Eventually, the file manager can handle the automatic closing of files
      by keeping track of who is in posession of the file through a reference
      count; at current, the file manager relies upon the user to close files
      when they arefinished, typically at the end of the experiment.</p>

  <h1>Output FileTypes</h1>

  <p>All output files have synchronized write operations.</p>

  
  <h2>OutFile</h2>
  
  <p>Generic text output file.  It is not compressed.</p>

  <h2>GZOutFile</h2>
  <p>Compressed (Java gzlib) text output file.</p>

  <h2>DelimitedOutFile</h2>
    <p>Compressed delimited output file.  It is not a barebones CSV.  Creation
    of a DelimitedOutFile requires not only a path, but a format string
    specifying the names <em>and types</em> of the output fields.  This
    information is used to (1) create a header at the top of the file for
    automated parsing (shell-style hash comment at column 0), followed by a
    string-style header delimited header row, followed then by each data
    row.</p>

  <h3>Example</h3>
  <pre>
  //Assuming fm is FileManager instance
  final String format = "Column1%d,Column2%s,Column3%f";
  DelimitedOutFile fot = fm.getDelimitedOutFile("foo.csv.gz", format);
  fot.write(1,"second",3.0);
  fm.close("foo.csv.gz");
  </pre>

  <h1>Input File Types</h1>
  <em>TODO: Input files are not currently handled by the file manager; this was primarly since they don't get re-used in different threads at the same time and therefore didn't require coordination</em>

  <h2>CommentStrippedInFile</h2>
    <p>Allows for a file to be read using the TextScanner interface.
    TextScanner allows for the next number, string, and non-blank line to be
    read from the input file.  For more information about its intended behavior,
    see java.util.Scanner.</p>

    <p>In general, this file type attempts to strip out (1) blank lines; (2)
    lines that begin with whitespace followed by a hash; (3) any text on a line
    (inclusive) following a hash.  This allows for files to be read with more
    complicated layouts than provided by the propertly list, including those
    with same-line comments as value/pairs.</p>

    <p>Currently, only events use this style of format.</p>


  <h1>Examples</h1>
      
  <h2>Creating the FileManager</h2>
  <p>
<pre>
FileManager fm = new FileManager();
String working_dir = "from/exec/working/dir";
try{
  fm.initialize(working_dir);
} catch (IOException e){
  System.err.println("Unable to create working dir.");
}
</pre>
  </p>

  <h2>Accessing a file</h2>
<pre>
public void testFile(FileManager fm){
  String file_to_open = "foo.csv.gz";
  //Delimited files are compressed automatically
  DelimitedOutFile fot = fm.getDelimitedOutFile(file_to_open);
  //fot will be new if the filemanager doesn't have it listed
  //as being active
  DelimitedOutFile fot2 = fm.getDelimitedOutFile(file_to_open);
  //fot2 will be the same object as fot  
}
</pre>
