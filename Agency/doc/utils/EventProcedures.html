  <h1>Summary</h1>

  <p>Events are places in code that pass state information to an
  EventManager.  The manager checks to see whether or not the event in
  combination with a passed piece of state information should cause any
  objects that implement the Procedure interface to be executed. For example, 
  ECJ's EPSimpleEvolutionState implements its own event manager that
  checks generation time at four different points in the code to see if any
  Procedures need to be triggered.  These events are:</p>

  <table>
    <tr style="font-weight:bold">
      <td>EventName</td>
      <td>State Checked</td>
      <td>Description</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>PREEVALUATION</td>
      <td>generation</td>
      <td>Occurs before the evaluator is executed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>POSTEVALUATION</td>
      <td>generation</td>
      <td>Occurs after the evaluator is finished, but before the breeder is
        executed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>POSTBREEDING</td>
      <td>generation</td>
      <td>Occurs after the breeding is complete; the execution loop ends prior
        to this location in code if the maximum generation is reached.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>GENERATION</td>
      <td>generation</td>
      <td>This event indicates that the EC event manager should prepare what
        follows as an event procedure configuration for the domain model.  In
        other words, events can be triggered in the domain model on a
        per-generation manner, coordinated by the ECJ event manager.</td>
    </tr> 
  </table>

  <p>A Procedure is an object that implements the Procedure interface.  Objects
  which implement this interface are constructed, initialized, and executed
  by when an event triggers them.</p>

  <p>The figure below shows an overview of the classes used to implement the
  Event Procedure utilities.  The remainder of this document will describe some
  of the classes in more detail, and it will provide example uses.</p>

  <h1>Event Procedure Manager</h1>


  <p>An event procedure manager creates Event Procedures, provides a byte-value
  to event mapping, and handles the processing of events.</p>

  <p>It's the responsibility of the Event Procedure Manager to only (1) parse
  Event Procedure Descriptions and prepare the containers; (2) check to see whether
  or not the container has a set of events to be triggered after passing state
  information to the appropriate container as determined by its internal event_type
  byte to event container mapping; (3) execute the procedures as instructed by
  the containers; (4) inform all containers to release all Procedure resources.</p>

  <p>Specific parts of the system implement their own event manager.  For
  example, the ECJ EPSimpleEvolutionState class implements an
  ECJEventProcedureManager that handles the events mentioned in the summary,
  and the Oligopoly model uses the MSEventProcedureManager (MarketSimulation)
  to handle its own internal triggers (currently, only the <tt>STEP</tt> event,
  which happens at the end of a step).</p>

  <p>Non-abstract (e.g. concrete) instances of the EventManager should handle their
  own mapping of <tt>EVENT_TYPE</tt> to byte values, provide means of accessing
  these byte values in a public fashion for objects to send as part of the
  arguments of a <tt>process(...)</tt> method, set up internal containers to
  store EventProcedures, read and process strings to create
  EventProcedureDescriptions, and populate the containers with the resulting
  EventProcedures described by the aforementioned descriptions.  Processing and
  finishing must also be handled by any concrete EventProcedureManager.  The
  base class for the Event Procedure Manager only provides utility static
  methods for parsing event procedure description files and strings.</p>


<h2>Event Procedure Descriptions</h2>

  <p>Event Procedure Descriptions  are objects that are created by the Event
  Procedure Manager.  Upon creation, they are used to instantiate Event
  Procedure objects; the original Event Procedure Description is stored along
  with the Event Procedure.</p>

  <p>Event Procedure Descriptions are configured by a single-line string in the
  form:</p>

  <pre>
EVENT_TRIGGER [when] ~ PROCEDURE_CLASS [key0=val0, ...]
</pre>

  <p>There are two halves to the string configuration: the event side and the
  procedure side; they are delimited by a tilde. </p>

  <p><tt>EVENT_TRIGGER</tt> is a string literal (e.g. one of the four
  mentioned in the Summary section of this document), <tt>when</tt> parametrizes
  the event with state information.  For example, it may be an Interval string
  in the form of "start:step:start" to describe conditions when the event should
  trigger.  The tilde separates the two halves of the event procedure
  description string.  Tildes should not be used anywhere in the first half of
  the event description, but may be used on the procedure side of the
  statement.</p>  
  
  <p><tt>PROCEDURE_CLASS</tt> is the canonical pathname to a class that
  implements the <tt>Procedure</tt> interface.  The final set of of values are
  key/value pairings in the form of <tt>key=value</tt>.  These arguments are
  passed to Procedures during their initial construction to alter the default
  behavior of Procedures (e.g. to handle things like changing the default file
  name).</p>

  <p>The Event Procedure Manager base class has static helper methods to read
  strings describing EventProcedureDescriptions from a configuration file
  compatible with <a href="FileManager.html">CommentStrippedInFiles</a> and
  individual strings.  The Event Manager then converts these
  EventProcedureDescriptions into EventProcedures and places them in the
  appropriate container.</p>

  <h2>Triggering Event Procedures</h2>
  <p>Objects that use the Event Procedure Manager communicate state information
  with it via the manager's <tt>process(event_id, context, exec_context)</tt>
  method.  The event_id is a byte that corresponds to a particular event container
  (these bytes are stored in the EventProcedureManager as final objects), a
  context to send to the container to see whether the event should be triggered
  (e.g.  generation time), and a variadic execution context, which allows for
  additional information to be passed to the procedure (e.g. a list of
  genotypes or a triggering firm, etc.).</p>

  <p>Before the Event Manager is destroyed (or the simulation ends), all
  objects which contain an Event Procedure Manager should call its finish()
  method to inform all Procedures to safely release resources.</p>

  <h1>Event Procedure</h1>

  <p>Event Procedures are simply events (represented by byte ID) paired
  with an object called an Event Procedure Description.  The description
  provides information about when to trigger the event, where to locate the
  Procedure class to trigger, and any configuration information (in the form
  of key/value maps) that should be passed to the Procedure when it is
  initialized.<p>

  <h2> Types of Event Procedures </h2>

  <p>Currently, an Event Procedure may be one of two types:<p>

  <ul>
    <li>ValuedEventProcedure: receives a double as a context and uses an
    interval object to keep track of what should be triggered.  Contexts are
    assumed to be monotonic and non-repeating.  An interval object has a
    start, step, and end values, which are used to create a regular pattern
    of states.  For example, the pattern 0:5:20 will be triggered when the
    value passed to the EventProcedure's container is either {0,5,15}, ordered.
    In configuration files, a single value of the string "end" will cause the
    event to only be triggered at the end.  "end" is also a valid end value.
    For example, the interval 0:5:end when generation number 19 is the last
    generation number for an experiment, for example, would be triggered
    during generations {0,5,15,19}.</li> <li>ContextFreeEventProcedure: the
    state information is not checked; any container that implements a context free
    event procedure always executes all events in the container.</li> </ul>

  <h2>Lifecycle of an Event Procedure</h2>

  <p>Perhaps the best way to describe what an Event Procedure is will be to
  write out its lifecycle.</p>

  <h3>Creation</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>An Event Procedure is described by an Event Procedure Description.  It
    is a string with the form mentioned in one of the sections above.  The Event
    Procedure Manager has helper methods to generate Event Procedure
    Descriptions from strings or files.
    <li>Event Procedure Descriptions are turned into Event Procedures.  Because
    <tt>EVENT_TYPE</tt>s are dependent upon their specific usage, it is the
    responsibility of a concrete Event Procedure Manager to parse the string
    literal describing the <tt>EVENT_TYPE</tt>, assign it a byte value for later
    mapping, and appropriately instantiating the Event Procedure.  For example,
    in the ECJEventProcedureManager, POSTEVALUATION is interpreted by the
    concrete manager as having a byte mapping of 2 and should be instantiated as
    a ValuedEventProcedure.
    <li>The created EventProcedure is stored in the appropriate container.  In
    the example used in the last point, the EventProcedure would be placed in a
    ValuedEventProcedureQueue.
  </ol>

  <h3>Triggering</h3>
  <ol>
    
    <li>In the source code, a statement exists in the form:
    <tt>process(event_id, event_context, execution_context)</tt>.  For the
    POSTEVALUATION example, the statement would look like:
    
<pre>
event_manager.process(event_manager.EVENT_POSTEVALUATION, state.generation, state)
</pre>
    
    <li>The event manager would then find the event procedure containers that
    map to the <tt>EVENT_POSTEVALUATION</tt> event id and pass
    <tt>state.generation</tt> to the container's processContext method.
    
    <li>The event procedure container queries its EventProcedures by calling
    their examine() method.  examine() returns an EventContext object that
    informs the container whether or not the event needs to be triggered.
    Currently, Event Procedures that return a value of <tt>PAST</tt> or
    <tt>CURRENT</tt> are interpreted as being ready for execution.
    
    <li>All event procedures matching (or preceding) the generation state
    information (in this example) would be removed from the container as they
    would return a <tt>PAST</tt> or <tt>CURRENT</tt> event context.  These
    procedures incremented to their next trigger value and replaced in the
    container (the internal container is a priority queue for
    ValueEventProcedures) unless they indicate they are done.  The
    EventProcedures that should be triggered are returned to the Event Manager
    for further processing.
    
    <li>The Event Manager then instructs each returned EventProcedure to execute
    its Procedure.

    <li>In the EventProcedure's execute method, the Procedure is created via
    reflection using the EventProcedureDescription if it has not already been
    created and setup using the Procedure's setup interface method.
    
    <li>The Procedure's execute() method is called with the
    <tt>execution_state</tt> information passed along to the Procedure.  In the
    example above, this would be the entire evolution state.  Multiple execution
    context objects may be passed.

    <li>The Procedure created by the EventProcedure is kept in the creating
    EventProcedure.  Creation occurs only once (or not at all if the
    EventProcedure is never triggered.)

  </ol>

  <h3>Destruction</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>At the end of an Event Manager's life, it should call the finish()
        method on all containers.
        <li>All containers call finish() on all EventProcedures
        <li>The EventProcedures call finish() its Procedure, if it has
        been instantiated.
        <li>The Procedure should release any resources it may have acquired over
        the course of its lifetime
      </ol>
  
  
  </ol>


  <h1>Procedures</h1>

  <p>Procedures are simply objects that implement the Procedure interface:</p>

<pre>
public interface Procedure extends Serializable {

  public void setup(EventProcedureArgs args) throws BadConfiguration;

  public void process(Object... context) throws Exception;

  public void finish();

}
</pre>

  <p>where <tt>setup()</tt> is called after the object is created but before it
  is processed; <tt>process(...)</tt> is the method that is called when the
  procedure is executed, receiving any <tt>execution_context</tt> sent from the
  triggering "hook" in the code, and <tt>finish()</tt> is called at the end of
  a Procedure's life to release any resources.</p>

  <p>Procedures can be custom tailored for particular applications; however, all
  current Procedures rely upon passing state information to be useful (such as
  an ECJ EvolutionState or a SimState object) as part of an execution context,
  rather than keeping a reference to those objects.  Instead, one could imagine
  a setup where the constructor binds these instances for the entire life of the
  Procedure</p>

  procedures would be to create an abstract class that implements Procedure but
  includes a more complicated constructor or setup method to perform these
  bindings.</p>
