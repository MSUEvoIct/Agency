 <div class="title">Agency: Iterated Cournot with Investment</div>

 <p class=abstract>This model provides an economic environment where an
  arbitrary number of firms can compete in an arbitrary number of markets for a
  single good. Each firm has a cobb-douglas form production function, where the
  amount of labor may be chosen freely each model time step but the level of
  capital is a function of the investment of that firm over time. Consumers are
  represented in the traditional fashion, as a demand curve where market
  clearing is performed by a virtual Walrasian auctioneer.</p>

 <h1>Model Description</h1>
 <h2>Economics</h2>

 <p>This ACE model uses an iterated version of the well-known and frequently
  studied Cournot oligopoly model, with a few twists-</p>

 <ul>
  <li>Firms compete in a configurable number of different markets at the
   same time. Combined production mechanic, this makes it possible that firms
   can cooperate by dividing up the available markets.
  <li>Firms have a cobb-douglas production function, so the cost of
   production depends not only on the quantity produced but the amount of
   capital invested. Related, firms have an opportunity to increase the size of
   their investments each model time step.
 </ul>

 <h2>Procedural Description</h2>

 <p>For each step the model runs, the following procedure is performed.
 <ol>
  <li>Each firm in the simulation, which is required to implement the <code>InvestmentFirm</code>
   interface, is asked through the <code>InvestmentFirm.purchaseCapital()</code>
   and <code>InvestmentFirm.setProduction()</code> functions to return the
   amount of capital to be invested and the quantity of the good to produce.
  <li>If either of these numbers would cause the firm to spend more
   resources than it currently has available, the amount is reduced to the
   maximum number that still prevents this condition. (Negative production and
   investment are also prohibited, and replaced with 0.0.) This process takes
   place once for each pair of firm and market in the simulation.
  <li>After the resources have been deducted from the firms, the total
   quantity of goods that has been produced in each market is determined, and,
   based on the demand parameters specified in the configuration file, a market
   price is calculated.
  <li>Based on the market price and the quantity produced by each firm, the
   firm's revenue is calculated and its resources are increased by that amount.




  
 </ol>

 <p>After this loop has been completed the number of times specified in the
  configuration file, the simulation is considered finished, and the fitness
  scores are delivered to the Agency simulation scheduling system so they can be
  aggregated and passed on to ECJ during the breeding phase.
 <h2>Parameters</h2>

 <p>This model has a number of different exogenous parameters which may be
  changed by modifying the associated lines in the configuration file. The
  parameters may effect both the quantitative and qualitative results of the
  model. For example, if investment costs are very high, it seems more likely
  that firms will divide up the available markets between themselves. There are
  few other hypotheses that would be interesting to test, and these are
  described in further detail below. Here is the list of parameters, along with
  the key used in the configuration file to specify them.</p>
 <ul>
  <li>The number of markets</li>
  <pre>eval.simrunner.sim.numMarkets = 2</pre>
  <li>The cost of capital</li>
  <pre>eval.simrunner.sim.capitalCost = 1</pre>
  <li>The cobb-douglas exponent for capital</li>
  <pre>eval.simrunner.sim.capitalExponent = 0.5</pre>
  <li>The cost of labor</li>
  <pre>eval.simrunner.sim.laborCost = 1</pre>
  <li>The cobb-douglas exponent for labor</li>
  <pre>eval.simrunner.sim.laborExponent = 0.5</pre>
  <li>The maximum amount a consumer is willing to pay</li>
  <pre>eval.simrunner.sim.maximumWTP = 1000</pre>
  <li>A coefficient and exponent describing how consumer WTP decreases with
   the number of consumers</li>
  <pre>eval.simrunner.sim.qtyRatio = 1.0
eval.simrunner.sim.qtyExponent = 1.0</pre>
 </ul>



 <h1>Code</h1>

 <h2>Implementation</h2>

 <p>
  The code for this model is in models/ source directory, in the package <code>abce.models.io.iterated.cournot.investment</code>,
  and the main simulation class is un-creatively named <code>InvestmentModel</code>.
  The parameters for consumer demand may vary across markets, and are stored in
  the public variables maximumWTP, qtyRatio, and qtyExponent.
 </p>

 <p>InvestmentModel implements the Java interface Runnable, so each model
  may be executed in a separate thread if desired. The inner model loop is
  specified in the InvestmentModel.run() function. First, the model steps all of
  firms by calling their purchaseCapital() and setProduction() functions, in
  that order. Once production is set, all markets are cleared by the
  InvestmentModel.clearMarket() function. This function aggregates the
  production quantities for each market, and uses the consumerWTP() function to
  determine the market price. Each firm then receives an amount of revenue equal
  to that price multiplied by that firm's amount of production. All that remains
  for the model step is to perform the maintenance of state variables to reflect
  the move to the next time step.</p>

 <p>Firms are required only to implement the
  abce.models.io.investment.InvestmentFirm interface. In addition to the
  purchaseCapital() and setProduction() functions described above, firms are
  required to implement interfaces that verify and actualize the actions for
  purchasing capital and setting production, represented by the
  CapitalPurchaseAction and ProductionAction classes respectively. This pattern
  should insure that agents do not e.g., spend more resources on production than
  they have available. A BasicInvestmentFirm class is also present to perform
  these functions using the general-purpose accounting code provided by Agency.</p>
